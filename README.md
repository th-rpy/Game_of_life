Here is my version of the famous cellular automaton Jeu De La Vie programmed in python in its version 3 (3.2.2 to be precise). It's a simple version, easy to understand (well it seems to me^^) and graphical (tkinter). It is possible to modify the size of the grid, the size of the cells and the wait between each step.
